  abstract = {The mental and behavioural traits that have evolved in humans, such as complex sociality, make us vulnerable to corresponding mental disorders, such as disorders that involve too little, or too much, social thinking. Autism can be considered as a disorder where complex sociality does not develop, while schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression can be considered as the opposite: pathologically overdeveloped social thought and behaviour, as seen, for example, in paranoia and hearing voices. Evolutionary biology is fundamentally important in understanding, defining, and treating mental disorders because it helps us to determine what the brain has evolved to do, which informs us about the different ways that brain functions can become dysregulated in disease.},
