  abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Two hundred million people worldwide experience some form of thyroid disorder, with women being especially at risk. However, why human thyroid function varies between populations, individuals and across the lifespan has attracted little research to date. This limits our ability to evaluate the conditions under which patterns of variation in thyroid function are best understood as ‘normal' or ‘pathological'. In this review, we aim to spark interest in research aimed at understanding the causes of variation in thyroid phenotypes. We start by assessing the biomedical literature on thyroid imbalance to discuss the validity of existing reference intervals for diagnosis and treatment across individuals and populations. We then propose an evolutionary ecological framework for understanding the phylogenetic, genetic, ecological, developmental and physiological causes of normal variation in thyroid function. We build on this approach to suggest testable predictions for how environmental challenges interact with individual circumstances to influence the onset of thyroid disorders. We propose that dietary changes, ecological disruptions of co-evolutionary processes during pregnancy and with pathogens, emerging infections and exacerbated stress responses can contribute to explaining the onset of thyroid diseases. For patients to receive the best personalised care, research into the causes of thyroid variation at multiple levels is needed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
