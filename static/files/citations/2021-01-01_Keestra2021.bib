  abstract = {Thyroid hormone reference intervals—used to determine normal thyroid function —currently don't take into account many significant factors that can cause variation in thyroid hormone levels. These factors include age, sex, ethnicity, season, time of day, iodine content in the diet, socioeconomic status, stress levels, body composition, immune status, menstrual cycle phase, and overall health status. This paper shows how early life experiences as well as short term stressors may affect variation in thyroid function. These are energetic challenges to which the thyroid physiology can respond to. Our investigation shows that much variation in thyroid function is natural. It may result from a complex interplay of evolutionary, genetic, developmental, and physiological factors in response to energetic challenges in the environment, beyond what is currently considered in biomedicine. A new research agenda for thyroid health should explore the way that diversity in thyroid function has evolved as a response to different contexts people live in—like focusing on how people's metabolisms adapt to the energetic requirements of their environments.},
