## Women are more driven to seek wealth and status than they are to reproduce

Classical ideas of evolution suggest fertility should increase as limitations enforced by scarce resources are removed allowing genes to be passed on through reproduction. These ideas seem to suggest that as wealth and status increase fertility should increase. However, recent patterns show that there is a negative relationship between access to resources and fertility. Researchers behind [this study](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2014.1733?rss=1) say wealthier and socially successful women are choosing to have smaller families, showing a drive for ‘status enhancement rather than fertility maximisation’.
