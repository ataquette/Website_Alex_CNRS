**We need you!!**

[Check out our latest **survey**](https://oxfordanthropology.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8bHC9OHudZtahaB) to help us understand better how the pandemic has influenced our menstrual cycles. 

Whether you are currently menstruating, pregnant, breastfeeding, on contraceptives, HRT, or having menopause, no matter whether or not you've been infected with COVID, **you can help**!!!!

If you are using a **menstrual cycle app** and are willing to share your data for research purposes only - you can also contact me directly - I am looking for digital health data collected before and during the pandemic. 

Thank you very much indeed!
