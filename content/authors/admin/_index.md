Since 2020 I have joined the Evolutionary Anthropology Lab in the [Institute for Evolutionary Sciences](http://www.isem.univ-montp2.fr/en/) (Montpellier University, France).

I seek to understand the role of the environment, be it social, cultural or pathogenic, in shaping diversity in reproductive and non-reproductive health. Some of the questions I am currently interested in are :

- Why do women discontinue modern contraception whilst in need of contraceptives ?
- What is the impact of infection on menstrual health ?
- How can we understand diversity in age at menopause ?
- What is the impact of reproduction on ageing ?
To answer those questions, I use various types of data (demographic, physiological, social networks, behavioural) from constrasted populations (the UK, India, Ethiopia and France).

I work with digital data (from the [Clue](https://helloclue.com/) & [BOOST Thyroid](https://www.boostthyroid.com/) apps), conduct fieldwork in India and Ethiopia, and collaborate with colleagues across various countries. 

Before joining [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/en), I have been an Associate Professor at the University of Oxford in the [School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography](https://www.anthro.ox.ac.uk/), and a Fellow of [Harris Manchester College](http://www.hmc.ox.ac.uk/). 

I serve as an associate editor for the journal [*Evolutionary Human Sciences*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/evolutionary-human-sciences)
