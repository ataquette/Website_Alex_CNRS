title: Contraceptive Side-Effects
---
In the developing world, millions of women discontinue hormonal contraception due to the experience of debilitating physiological side-effects (e.g. excessive and irregular bleeding), yet the causes of these adverse effects is not known. This project aims to test the hypothesis that side-effects are caused by unnecessarily high dosage of exogenous hormones in hormonal contraceptives compared with women’s endogenous hormones, with the aims of accumulating primary evidence for optimizing contraception to communities and individuals. The research focuses on the use of injectables in Ethiopia, where unmet needs for contraception reach the highest levels in Africa. 

This project is in collaboration with **Dr Eshetu Gurmu (co-PI)** from Addis Ababa University and **Rose Stevens** (DPhil candidate, University of Oxford). See our first [workshop](http://www.aau.edu.et/blog/workshop-holds-on-overcoming-contraceptive-discontinuation/) here. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the project has been put on pause for the time being.

Our panel of **expert advisors** for the project include Dr Sissay (Gynecologist, Ethiopia), Dr Tamrat (Microbiologist, Ethiopia), Dr Smith (LSHTM, UK), Dr Vitzthum (Indiana University, USA), Dr Sear (LSHTM, UK) and Dr Cresswell (WHO).
