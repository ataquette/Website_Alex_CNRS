# Moving on from why menopause evolve to understanding diversity in age at menopause

In this project we aim to test the hypothesis that the determinants of age of natural menopause may be similar to the genetic, developmental and ecological determinants of ageing.

This project is in collaboration with Abby Fraser (PhD candidate, University of Glasgow). If you want to know more about menopause have a look at Abby's video below.
