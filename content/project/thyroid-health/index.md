We propose that dietary changes, ecological disruptions of co-evolutionary processes during pregnancy and with pathogens, emerging infections and exacerbated stress responses can contribute to explaining the onset of thyroid diseases. 

This is project together with [BOOST Thyroid](https://www.boostthyroid.com/) and Sarai Keestra (Netherlands).
