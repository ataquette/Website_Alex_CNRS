abstract: This   paper   investigates   the   importance of women’s physiological condition for predicting the risk of discontinuation due to side-effects of the injectable contraceptive in  Ethiopia, where side-effects account for around 20% of all discontinuations. Contraceptive calendar data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey were analysed. Women aged 15-49 who  had  initiated  the  injectable  contraceptive  in  the  two  years  prior  to  interview  were  included  in  the  analysis  (N=1,513).   After checking for reverse  causality, the associations  between physiological risk factors and discontinuation of the injectable contraceptive due to either side-effects  (DSE) or other reasons (DOR) were estimated using multivariate Cox proportional regression analyses.  Results In 2016, 10% of women had initiated the injectable in the last two years, and 1 in 4 had discontinued use by the time of the interview. Of these, 1 in 5 discontinued due  to  side-effects.  Women  with  anaemia  were  at  twice  the  risk  of  DSE  compared  with  non-anaemic  women,  while  anaemia  status  was  not  associated  with  DOR.  The  association between anaemia and experience of side-effects is likely driven by iron-deficiency anaemia, as having taken iron supplements during last pregnancy is found to  decrease  the  risk  of  DSE.  Sociocultural  factors  including  religion,  wealth  and  relationship status were significant predictors for DOR, but not for DSE. Accounting   for   diversity   in   physiological   condition   is   key   for   understanding  contraceptive  discontinuation  due  to  side-effects.  To  reduce  side-effects  and  thereby  unmet  need  for  contraception,  family  planning  programs  may  benefit from providing an integrated service package addressing anaemia as well as supplying hormonal contraception.

summary: Most scholarly arguments explaining why women discontinue using modern contraceptives whilst in need have focused on sociocultural factors. Drawing on reproductive ecology, we show that a new model taking into account a  physiological aetiology is needed to explain interindividual variation in the experience of contraceptive side-effects.
