abstract: In this talk I will present my work contraceptive dynamics in Ethiopia, drawing on evolutionary approaches for understanding the adoption and discontinuation of modern contraception. I will discuss the importance of considering not just adoption but also discontinuation for understanding the cultural evolution of feftility decline. I will argue that integrating public health and evolutionary approaches to reproductive behaviour might advance both fields by providing (i) a predictive framework for comparing the effectiveness of various public health strategies and (ii) a more realistic picture of behaviour by considering ‘culture loss’ at the individual level more explicitly when modelling the cultural evolution of low fertility.
